* tbd

## Version 1.0.0 (2020-11-03)
* **Initial 1.0.0 GA release**
* `jfr-mappers` module [no longer depends on `telemetry-java-http11`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/pull/90).
* [Fix for a potential freeze](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/pull/97) when the number of events in a 
single JFR recording file exceeds the maximum queue size.
* [Clean up temp dirs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/pull/96) to prevent resource leak.
* [Use camel case](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/pull/100) for event/metric names instead of inconsistent delimiter.
* [Clear per-thread cache data](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/pull/101) between harvest cycles to prevent monotonic growth.
* [Omit the service name](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/pull/102) when the java agent is also running on the target process (favor using entity guid instead).

## Version 0.5.0 (2020-09-30)
* Update telemetry sdk to 0.8.0.
* Minor documentation/readme [change](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/pull/83).

## Version 0.4.0 (2020-09-22)

* JFR Daemon - If the agent is present, no longer wait for the agent to connect to obtain an entity guid.
Instead, buffer the data and wait to send it until the entity guid is available.
